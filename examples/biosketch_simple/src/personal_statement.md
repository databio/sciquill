I am an assistant professor leading a group in computational biology. My research consists of applying molecular and computational methods to generate and analyze large-scale epigenomic data. In this process, I develop novel analytical approaches and implement open-source computational tools focused on specific biological questions. The general biological goal of my work is to understand the basic biology of gene regulation and epigenetics. I am interested in how DNA encodes regulatory networks to enable cellular differentiation, and how these regulatory systems break down in disease. To better understand normal and diseased gene regulation, I collect high-throughput genome-scale data in single cells and cell populations, and then harness the power of supercomputing, machine learning, and software engineering to answer questions about biological systems.
