# Sciquill examples

These are skeleton examples for how to create different
media types using the sciquill philosophy. Just copy the folder and edit the documents to start a new project.

Each media type has a `src` subfolder where the markdown source documents will live, and an `output` folder where the rendered PDF output goes. Each also comes with a `_markmeld.yaml` file, which configures the outputs. You can build them by executing `markmeld <target>` from within the example folder.
