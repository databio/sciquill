One of my major contributions has been in cancer epigenomics. In my first major study in Ewing sarcoma, I led the computational analysis of a multi-omic dataset profiling 7 histone marks, RNA-seq, DNA methylation, and ATAC-seq of Ewing sarcoma [@Tomazou2015]. I also led a follow-up study of DNA methylation in a large cohort of Ewing sarcoma patient samples [@Sheffield2017]. Finally, I have contributed to other projects in other cancers, including Glioblastoma, breast cancer [@Lawson2020] and cell-to-cell cancer heterogeneity. As I have started my own group, I have extended these general analytical approaches to other cancers, including development of new approaches to assess breast cancer.
