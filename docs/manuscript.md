# Building a manuscript with sciquill

## Examples of input/output

I use markmeld to produce all our lab's preprints. I've made some jinja templates available here:

[https://github.com/databio/mm_templates/tree/master/manuscript](https://github.com/databio/mm_templates/tree/master/manuscript)

There are few example repositories showing how this works:

The markmeld repository contains a [demo](https://github.com/databio/markmeld/tree/master/demo).

There's also a standalone demo here that also shows you how to use a github action to build the manuscript:

[https://github.com/databio/sciquill_paper_example](https://github.com/databio/sciquill_paper_example)

I still need to work on a full demo for how to build it on your own, which I plan to put in the examples folder in this repository.
